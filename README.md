# LinearSearchProgram

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Linear Search algorithm in C++. The program allows the user to search for a target element within an array of integers, and outputs the index of the element if it is found.

## Features

- **Linear Search Algorithm**: The algorithm checks each element in the array sequentially to find the target.
- **User Input**: The user can input a target number, which the program will attempt to locate in the array.
- **Result Output**: The program will return the index of the target if found, or notify the user that the element is not present.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LinearSearchProgram.git
